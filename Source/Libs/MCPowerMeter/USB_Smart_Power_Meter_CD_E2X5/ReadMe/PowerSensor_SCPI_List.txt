SCPI commands may send to the Sensor by Ethernet or for some models by USB :

SCPI_Command List: (Supported by model: PWR-SEN-8GHS-RC , PWR-SEN-8P-RC and SSG-6400HS)
:FREQ:<value>   - Value is always in MHz Example:  :FREQ:2355
:TEMP:FORMAT:<X> - X can be "C" for Celsius ( °C) or "F" for Fahrenheit (°F)
:MODE:<mode> - valid number for mode is: 0 for Low Noise mode, 1 for faster mode and 2 (if supported)  for Very fast mode. Example: :MODE:1
:AVG:COUNT<count> - Set the Avg Count. example: :AVG:COUNT:8
:AVG:STATE:X -  if X=1 then Enable AVG. if X=0 - disable AVG. (default state is 0 (Disable).

SCPI QUERY List:  
:POWER?           Example:   :POWER?   return: -22.05 dBm.
:FREQ?   - Get the current Frequency ( as it set for cal factor calculation ).
:MN?  - Get the Power Sensor Model Mame
:SN? - Get the Power Sensor Serial Number.
:FIRMWARE? - Get the Firmware.
:TEMP? - Get the device temperature.
:TEMP:FORMAT? - Get the current Temperature format. 
:MODE?    - Get the Sensor mode: 0 for Low Noise 1 for fast mode , 2 for fastest mode.
:AVG:STATE? - return 1 if the AVG is enabled or 0 if Disabled
:AVG:COUNT? - get the AVG count value.
:VOLTAGE? - reading voltage.

For the entire SCAPI Command and Query List refer to the Programming Guide of the specific device.

Communication With the Device with Telnet Protocol:

Communication with the device started by creating a Telnet Connection and receiving LF (Line feed) from the Device.
if Password is required then the first command that must be sent is: PWD=[Password].
any legal command can be send in Telnet and must be followed by LF (Line Feed).
