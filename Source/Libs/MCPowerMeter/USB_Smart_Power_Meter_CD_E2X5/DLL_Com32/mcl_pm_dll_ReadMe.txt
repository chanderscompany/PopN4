mcl_pm.dll - ActiveX COM Object for programmers

This DLL file can be used by programmers of Visual Basic,VC++,Delphi,C#,
LabView or any other program that recognize ActiveX DLL file.

mcl_pm.dll file should be located on system folder eg: "c:\windows\system32"
the file should be registered using regsvr32 windows program.

The DLL file object has the following Properties:

Freq : the CAl Freq in MHz
AVG  : 1=ON 0=OFF
AvgCount: the No of Avg Count
Format_mW: if true the ReadPower result will be in mW
OffsetValue_Enable : 0= Disable ; 1=Enable Single Offset Value ;  2= Enable Offset Array values 
OffsetValue - Offset Single Value 

program Example in VB:

public pm1 As New MCL_PM.USB_PM  'this line recommended to be in a global module

pm1.Open_Sensor
pm1.Freq=1500
r=pm1.ReadPower
pm1.Close_Sensor     ' Recommended to close connection in the END of the program

Note: The Open_Sensor takes several sec,
      so, it is better to "Close_Sensor" only when the program is 
      closed.
 

program Example in Visual C++:

mcl_pm::USB_PM ^pm1 = gcnew mcl_pm::USB_PM();
short Status = 0;
System::String ^SN = "";
float ReadResult = 0;
Status = pm1->Open_Sensor(SN);
pm1->Freq = 3000;
ReadResult = pm1->ReadPower();
pm1->Close_Sensor();
