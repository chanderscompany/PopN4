The *.tix files are GoodSync job files exported from DAC's PC.
Import these into your GoodSync.
Modify the source and destination folders to match your folder structure.

GoodSync copies files and subfolders that have changed from a source folder to a destination folder, excluding files and file types in an excluded file list.

The first job, POPN4 Install 1, copies files needed to run POPN4 from the POPN4 output folder (...\bin\debug) to a separate folder (c:\POPN4 Install).
The second job, POPN4 Install 2, copies files from the c: drive install folder to an install folder on an external removable drive.
The next job, VS Projects, copies all important project files to a backup external drive.
